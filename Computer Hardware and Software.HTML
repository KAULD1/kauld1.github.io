<center><h1>Computer Hardware and Software</h1></center>

<p>Hardware and software are the two major parts of a computer. Computer hardware are the parts that you can physically touch. Were as computer software is inside the computer as a program.
</p>

<h2>Computer Hardware</h2>

<p>Computer hardware is the physical parts of the computer system. Their are some parts inside the computer case called internal hardware and some outside the computer case called external hardware.
</p>

<h3>External Hardware</h3>

<p>External hardware is positioned on the outside of the computer case but is connected to it through bluetooth, AUX cord, USB cord, etc. Examples of external hardware are printers, speakers, a mouse and headsets as the are all separate from the computer but can be connected to it.
</p>

<h3>Internal Harware</h3>

<p>Internal hardware is positioned in the inside of the computer case. These pieces of hardware  are the most important as without them the computer wouldn’t work at all. Examples of internal hardware are hard drives, motherboards, processors, Random Access Memory (R.A.M), graphics cards and the Central Processing Unit (C.P.U)
</p>

<h4>Input Hardware</h4>
<p>Input hardware is external hardware, it is used to provide information and data to the computer. For example microphones, keyboard, mouse and controllers.
</p>

<h4>Output Hardware</h4>
<p>Output hardware is external hardware, it is used to reciev information and data from a computer. For example monitors, speakers, printer and headphones. 
</p>

<h4>Storage Hardware</h4>
<p>Storage hardware can be internal or external hardware, it is used to store information and data. For example harddrive, USB, floppy disc and internet.

<h2>Computer Software</h2> 

<p>Computer software is inside the computer as a collection of instructions for a it to follow. This is so that the user can interact with a computer, it's hardware and perform tasks. </p>

<h3>Application Software</h3>

<p>Application software is a computer program designed to perform a specific task, function or activity to benefit the user. Examples of application software are Microsoft Office, Adobe Flash Player, iTunes, macOS, Skype, Battle.net, Steam and Origin. 
</p>

<h3>System Software</h3>

<p>System software are programs like the operating system and utility programs. These allow you to control and use a computer. They enable the computer to complete file transfers, launch applications, control hardware configuration, enables the computer startup or boot process, manages your files on the harddrive and protects your computer from this like unauthorised users.
